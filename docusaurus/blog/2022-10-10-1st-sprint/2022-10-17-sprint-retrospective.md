**Attendees**: all 

* **What went well?**
    * We were able to show the working software to the stakeholders and we received positive feedback.

* **What were the problem?**
    * Enable to finish all tasks according to the definition of ready.  
    * The product owner didn't work on the product backlog for the sprint.

* **Lesson learned**
    * Product owner prepares the backlog for the next print. Is responsible to create, refine and prioritize user stories, 
    estimating story points and defining acceptance  criteria.
    * Every week the stakeholders are expecting new increments. Sprint review should be used to share the product increment.
    * Every piece of software should be tested at least in a minimal way (unit testing, independent of external services).
