# Introduction to the Project

This project will tackle the development of a software solution for a security company named SecCom. SecCom is a company that ensures critical buildings are not broken into, through the installation and operation of CCTV cameras on-premises.

Although, SecCom is still not foresting the technological advancements in the security monitoring field, having several people monitoring the cameras of the most critical buildings.
The goal of your team is to help SecCom with their transition to the digital world, creating an automatic system that can identify intruders without human-intervention and act accordingly.
With their digital transition, SecCom will also install several light and sound alarms on the spaces they are protecting and wishes for them to be automatically activated every time an intruder is detected. Besides this, SecCom also expects that your team develops a top-to-bottom solution they can use manage the cameras and alarms installed on-premises and to manage all their clients and buildings monitored.
